Creating a complete 3D game from scratch would be quite complex, but I can provide you with a basic template for a 3D game using a popular game engine like Unity. Below is a simple example of how you can create a spinning cube in Unity:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class CubeController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float rotationSpeed = 50f;

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        // Rotate the cube around its center
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.up, rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
    }
}
```

To use this code:

1. Open Unity and create a new 3D project.
2. Create a new Cube GameObject in the scene.
3. Attach the above script (`CubeController.cs`) to the Cube GameObject.
4. Adjust the rotation speed parameter in the script or in the Unity Inspector to change how fast the cube spins.
5. Press Play to run the game and see the cube spinning.

This is just a very basic example to get you started. From here, you can expand and customize your game by adding more objects, interactions, scripts, and assets as needed. If you have specific features or mechanics in mind, feel free to ask for more guidance!
